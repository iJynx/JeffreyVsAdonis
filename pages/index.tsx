        <h4>
          I have made this website to assist in my self-improvement journey and
          hopefully yours too. I vouch to constantly update and work on this
          webstie, so it can become the ultimate self-improvement toolkit. At
          the moment there are two features: the daily progress bar and the
          quality calculator. The daily progress bar is quite simple, you
          add/subtract all the habits you've done that day, and the site gives
          you the potential you have reached in that day through an intuitive
          progress bar. The quality calcuator roughly estimates your quality as
          a man, I recommend you ask your friends for objective opinions on some
          of them, such as physical appearance.
